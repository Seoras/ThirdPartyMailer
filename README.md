Unfortunately, not all mail clients offer URL schemes to be supported by `ThirdPartyMailer`. If youâ€™re aware of another candidate, please let us know [Swift](https://github.com/vtourraine/ThirdPartyMailer/issues) [ObjC](https://github.com/seoras/ThirdPartyMailer/issues).


## How to install

Manually import the files from the Source folder. Pod support maybe added later.

Open your App's info.plist file and add the key "LSApplicationQueriesSchemes", or update it, with the all the schemes found in [ThirdPartyMailer.plist](https://github.com/Seoras/ThirdPartyMailer/blob/master/Source/ThirdPartyMailer.plist). e.g.

```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
	<array>
		<string>googlegmail</string>
		<string>readdle-spark</string>
		<string>x-dispatch</string>
		<string>airmail</string>
		<string>ms-outlook</string>
		<string>ymail</string>
	</array>
```
